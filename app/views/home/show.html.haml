    %p My name is Jelle Vandebeeck and I love iOS development. I craft the coolest applications for an Antwerp based company called iCapps. And in my spare time I try to create some cool iOS and Mac appications.
    %p When I'm not coding or drinking beer, you'll probably find me somewhere in the sky looking for some thermals.

  %h3 Here are the apps I created:
  .grid
    - @apps.each do |app|
      %figure
        = image_tag app.dashboard_image.url
        %figcaption
          %h2 
            = app.name
            %span= app.name_suffix
          %p= app.short_text
          = link_to 'View', app.detail_url
